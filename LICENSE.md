## Design License

The look and feel of the Culturemap map design is also derived (although heavily altered) from [OSM Liberty](https://github.com/maputnik/osm-liberty) which is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

For a browsable electronic map based on OpenMapTiles and OpenStreetMap data, the credit should appear in the corner of the map. For example:

[Â© OpenStreetMap contributors](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)

For printed and static maps a similar attribution should be made in a textual description near the image, in the same fashion as if you cite a photograph.

## Icons

Culturemap is using the [Maki POI icon set](https://github.com/mapbox/maki/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) which is licensed under CC0 1.0 Universal.

The right arrow was derived from [Wikipedia][wiki_arrow] which is in the public domain.

## Fonts

Culturemap is using [Berlin Type](https://www.hvdfonts.com/custom-cases/berlin-type).
